										<p>According to Neil Oatley, the success of the MP4-13 allowed West McLaren Mercedes "to push the design of the MP4-14 more that we would have been comfortable with the previous year. We had more time with the next car, and could afford to be a little more adventurous in some of its mechanical aspects."</p>

										<p>None of this prevented yet another season's racing being run down to the wire, but what from the word go was that McLaren's new car was one of its most ambitious designs ever. With a lighter, lower V10 from Mercedes-Benz, it also showcased a host of new innovations brought in by Adrian Newey.</p>

										<p>Accordingly, at its launch Dennis explicitly rejected the word evolutionary, describing it instead as a new car which "represents the biggest single step we felt we could take for 1999 with perhaps the smallest-ever percentage of carry-over components from last year's car."</p>

										<p>The new F0 100H now developed around 785bhp at 16,700rpm, and Newey battled to make the most of this by recovering as much grip as possible which would otherwise have been lost to a mandated, footprint-reducing fourth groove in the front tyre. The car now sported a new mid-height nose with a pair of high-aided bargeboards mounted either aide of the cockpit. To the rear, but ahead of the driven wheels, large deflector panels made the car instantly recognisable.</p>

										<p>Newey also reordered the packaging to a great degree, something he would clearly have done a year earlier had the timeframe allowed. He relocated the oil tank and hydraulic system and fitted a new, shorter gearbox, and the redued weight of the new car allowed for some more creative ballasting with various ancillaries stowed within the walls of the monocoque. New torsion-bar rear suspension was added to the mix, while the front remained fundamentally been on MP4-13.</p>

										<p>According to Neil Oatley, the success of the MP4-13 allowed West McLaren Mercedes "to push the design of the MP4-14 more that we would have been comfortable with the previous year.

										<p>None of this prevented yet another season's racing being run down to the wire, but what from the word go was that McLaren's new car was one of its most ambitious designs ever. With a lighter, lower V10 from Mercedes-Benz, it also showcased a host of new innovations brought in by Adrian Newey.</p>

										<p>Accordingly, at its launch Dennis explicitly rejected the word evolutionary, describing it instead as a new car which "represents the biggest single step we felt we could take for 1999 with perhaps the smallest-ever percentage of carry-over components from last year's car."</p>

										<p>The new F0 100H now developed around 785bhp at 16,700rpm, and Newey battled to make the most of this by recovering as much grip as possible which would otherwise have been lost to a mandated, footprint-reducing fourth groove in the front tyre. The car now sported a new mid-height nose with a pair of high-aided bargeboards mounted either aide of the cockpit. To the rear, but ahead of the driven wheels, large deflector panels made the car instantly recognisable.</p>

										<p>Newey also reordered the packaging to a great degree, something he would clearly have done a year earlier had the timeframe allowed. He relocated the oil tank and hydraulic system and fitted a new, shorter gearbox, and the redued weight of the new car allowed for some more creative ballasting with various ancillaries stowed within the walls of the monocoque. New torsion-bar rear suspension was added to the mix, while the front remained fundamentally been on MP4-13.</p>

										<p>According to Neil Oatley, the success of the MP4-13 allowed West McLaren Mercedes "to push the design of the MP4-14 more that we would have been comfortable with the previous year. We had more time with the next car, and could afford to be a little more adventurous in some of its mechanical aspects."</p>

										<p>None of this prevented yet another season's racing being run down to the wire, but what from the word go was that McLaren's new car was one of its most ambitious designs ever. With a lighter, lower V10 from Mercedes-Benz, it also showcased a host of new innovations brought in by Adrian Newey.</p>

										<p>Accordingly, at its launch Dennis explicitly rejected the word evolutionary, describing it instead as a new car which "represents the biggest single step we felt we could take for 1999 with perhaps the smallest-ever percentage of carry-over components from last year's car."</p>

										<p>The new F0 100H now developed around 785bhp at 16,700rpm, and Newey battled to make the most of this by recovering as much grip as possible which would otherwise have been lost to a mandated, footprint-reducing fourth groove in the front tyre. The car now sported a new mid-height nose with a pair of high-aided bargeboards mounted either aide of the cockpit. To the rear, but ahead of the driven wheels, large deflector panels made the car instantly recognisable.</p>

										<p>Newey also reordered the packaging to a great degree, something he would clearly have done a year earlier had the timeframe allowed. He relocated the oil tank and hydraulic system and fitted a new, shorter gearbox, and the redued weight of the new car allowed for some more creative ballasting with various ancillaries stowed within the walls of the monocoque. New torsion-bar rear suspension was added to the mix, while the front remained fundamentally been on MP4-13.</p>

										<p>According to Neil Oatley, the success of the MP4-13 allowed West McLaren Mercedes "to push the design of the MP4-14 more that we would have been comfortable with the previous year. We had more time with the next car, and could afford to be a little more adventurous in some of its mechanical aspects."</p>

										<p>None of this prevented yet another season's racing being run down to the wire, but what from the word go was that McLaren's new car was one of its most ambitious designs ever. With a lighter, lower V10 from Mercedes-Benz, it also showcased a host of new innovations brought in by Adrian Newey.</p>

										<p>Accordingly, at its launch Dennis explicitly rejected the word evolutionary, describing it instead as a new car which "represents the biggest single step we felt we could take for 1999 with perhaps the smallest-ever percentage of carry-over components from last year's car."</p>

										<p>The new F0 100H now developed around 785bhp at 16,700rpm, and Newey battled to make the most of this by recovering as much grip as possible which would otherwise have been lost to a mandated, footprint-reducing fourth groove in the front tyre. The car now sported a new mid-height nose with a pair of high-aided bargeboards mounted either aide of the cockpit. To the rear, but ahead of the driven wheels, large deflector panels made the car instantly recognisable.</p>

										<p>Newey also reordered the packaging to a great degree, something he would clearly have done a year earlier had the timeframe allowed. He relocated the oil tank and hydraulic system and fitted a new, shorter gearbox, and the redued weight of the new car allowed for some more creative ballasting with various ancillaries stowed within the walls of the monocoque. New torsion-bar rear suspension was added to the mix, while the front remained fundamentally been on MP4-13.</p>

										<p>None of this prevented yet another season's racing being run down to the wire, but what from the word go was that McLaren's new car was one of its most ambitious designs ever. With a lighter, lower V10 from Mercedes-Benz, it also showcased a host of new innovations brought in by Adrian Newey.</p>

										<p>Accordingly, at its launch Dennis explicitly rejected the word evolutionary, describing it instead as a new car which "represents the biggest single step we felt we could take for 1999 with perhaps the smallest-ever percentage of carry-over components from last year's car."</p>

										<p>The new F0 100H now developed around 785bhp at 16,700rpm, and Newey battled to make the most of this by recovering as much grip as possible which would otherwise have been lost to a mandated, footprint-reducing fourth groove in the front tyre. The car now sported a new mid-height nose with a pair of high-aided bargeboards mounted either aide of the cockpit. To the rear, but ahead of the driven wheels, large deflector panels made the car instantly recognisable.</p>

										<p>Newey also reordered the packaging to a great degree, something he would clearly have done a year earlier had the timeframe allowed. He relocated the oil tank and hydraulic system and fitted a new, shorter gearbox, and the redued weight of the new car allowed for some more creative ballasting with various ancillaries stowed within the walls of the monocoque. New torsion-bar rear suspension was added to the mix, while the front remained fundamentally been on MP4-13.</p>

										<p>According to Neil Oatley, the success of the MP4-13 allowed West McLaren Mercedes "to push the design of the MP4-14 more that we would have been comfortable with the previous year. We had more time with the next car, and could afford to be a little more adventurous in some of its mechanical aspects."</p>

										<p>None of this prevented yet another season's racing being run down to the wire, but what from the word go was that McLaren's new car was one of its most ambitious designs ever. With a lighter, lower V10 from Mercedes-Benz, it also showcased a host of new innovations brought in by Adrian Newey.</p>

										<p>Accordingly, at its launch Dennis explicitly rejected the word evolutionary, describing it instead as a new car which "represents the biggest single step we felt we could take for 1999 with perhaps the smallest-ever percentage of carry-over components from last year's car."</p>

										<p>The new F0 100H now developed around 785bhp at 16,700rpm, and Newey battled to make the most of this by recovering as much grip as possible which would otherwise have been lost to a mandated, footprint-reducing fourth groove in the front tyre. The car now sported a new mid-height nose with a pair of high-aided bargeboards mounted either aide of the cockpit. To the rear, but ahead of the driven wheels, large deflector panels made the car instantly recognisable.</p>

										<p>Newey also reordered the packaging to a great degree, something he would clearly have done a year earlier had the timeframe allowed. He relocated the oil tank and hydraulic system and fitted a new, shorter gearbox, and the redued weight of the new car allowed for some more creative ballasting with various ancillaries stowed within the walls of the monocoque. New torsion-bar rear suspension was added to the mix, while the front remained fundamentally been on MP4-13.</p>

										<p>According to Neil Oatley, the success of the MP4-13 allowed West McLaren Mercedes "to push the design of the MP4-14 more that we would have been comfortable with the previous year. We had more time with the next car, and could afford to be a little more adventurous in some of its mechanical aspects."</p>

										<p>None of this prevented yet another season's racing being run down to the wire, but what from the word go was that McLaren's new car was one of its most ambitious designs ever. With a lighter, lower V10 from Mercedes-Benz, it also showcased a host of new innovations brought in by Adrian Newey.</p>

										<p>Accordingly, at its launch Dennis explicitly rejected the word evolutionary, describing it instead as a new car which "represents the biggest single step we felt we could take for 1999 with perhaps the smallest-ever percentage of carry-over components from last year's car."</p>

										<p>The new F0 100H now developed around 785bhp at 16,700rpm, and Newey battled to make the most of this by recovering as much grip as possible which would otherwise have been lost to a mandated, footprint-reducing fourth groove in the front tyre. The car now sported a new mid-height nose with a pair of high-aided bargeboards mounted either aide of the cockpit. To the rear, but ahead of the driven wheels, large deflector panels made the car instantly recognisable.</p>

										<p>Newey also reordered the packaging to a great degree, something he would clearly have done a year earlier had the timeframe allowed. He relocated the oil tank and hydraulic system and fitted a new, shorter gearbox, and the redued weight of the new car allowed for some more creative ballasting with various ancillaries stowed within the walls of the monocoque. New torsion-bar rear suspension was added to the mix, while the front remained fundamentally been on MP4-13.</p>

									<p>None of this prevented yet another season's racing being run down to the wire, but what from the word go was that McLaren's new car was one of its most ambitious designs ever. With a lighter, lower V10 from Mercedes-Benz, it also showcased a host of new innovations brought in by Adrian Newey.</p>

									<p>Accordingly, at its launch Dennis explicitly rejected the word evolutionary, describing it instead as a new car which "represents the biggest single step we felt we could take for 1999 with perhaps the smallest-ever percentage of carry-over components from last year's car."</p>

									<p>The new F0 100H now developed around 785bhp at 16,700rpm, and Newey battled to make the most of this by recovering as much grip as possible which would otherwise have been lost to a mandated, footprint-reducing fourth groove in the front tyre. The car now sported a new mid-height nose with a pair of high-aided bargeboards mounted either aide of the cockpit. To the rear, but ahead of the driven wheels, large deflector panels made the car instantly recognisable.</p>

									<p>Newey also reordered the packaging to a great degree, something he would clearly have done a year earlier had the timeframe allowed. He relocated the oil tank and hydraulic system and fitted a new, shorter gearbox, and the redued weight of the new car allowed for some more creative ballasting with various ancillaries stowed within the walls of the monocoque. New torsion-bar rear suspension was added to the mix, while the front remained fundamentally been on MP4-13.</p>
